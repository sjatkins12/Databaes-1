# CrateYourself

This repository is the result of a CMPSC class group project.

The Databaes Team has developed a database-driven web application that will offer a subscription-based service to its clients.

This web application, Crate Yourself, offers a product to those who enjoy receiving monthly gift boxes containing items relating to their interests. 
The specific contents of these monthly boxes are unknown to the subscriber until the point of opening, however, users have the added ability to vote on a featured item that is guaranteed to appear in their next box.
